Role of each member:
Ginny is responsible for implementing anti-aliasing, depth of field, refraction and Fresnel law.
Jordan is responsible for setting up basic ray tracing, implementing recursive ray tracing, soft shadows, texture mapping, reflection and glossy effect.
Both two members worked together in setting up scenes and testing features.
